# FEMA Flood Payout
Fema Flood Payout Prediction
The prediction model proposed helps the user determine the potential Fema payout for their property incase of a flooding.

The model also explores climate change . It will help the user get a better understanding of insurance costs and their implications on their property. The model will focus on a US wide coverage as different regions of the country as affected by different types of flooding. For instance the West coast is more prone to flooding through rising sea levels, while Central can face damages due to flash flooding. East cost is also more susceptible to hurricanes.

The data is collected from the Fema website. The data set will cover payouts dated as far back as 19xx.

Using this model, we hope to be able to predict the Fema payout for a user's property provided their zip code, flood zone and year their property was constructed in.
